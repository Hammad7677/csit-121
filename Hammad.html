        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>

        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>

        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>

    </ul>



    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>

        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>

        <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed until well combined.</li>

        <li>Stir in the boiling water until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>

        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.</li>

        <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>

        <li>Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove from pans and cool completely on a wire rack.</li>

        <li>Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>



    <p>This is my favorite recipe because it yields a moist and delicious chocolate cake that never fails to impress. The combination of rich cocoa and buttermilk makes it incredibly flavorful, and the simple preparation steps make it a go-to dessert for any occasion.</p>
